"""Provides a centralized, and flexible Publish-Subscribe facility for Python

I've stolen ideas from:

 - http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnpag/html/despublishsubscribe.asp
 - Sascha Matzke's LoggingKit for Webware
 - Trent Mick's PEP 282 and Vinay Sajip's logging package
